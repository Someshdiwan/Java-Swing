Explanation of Changes

1. Making It Dynamic
User-Selected Root Directory:
Added a JMenuBar with a "File" menu containing an "Open" option.
When "Open" is clicked, a JFileChooser (set to DIRECTORIES_ONLY) allows the user to pick a root directory.

The setNewRoot method updates the tree with this new root.

The initial root defaults to the user’s home directory (System.getProperty("user.home")), making it more portable than
a hardcoded path.

Dynamic Tree Updates:
The setNewRoot method creates a new DefaultMutableTreeNode for the selected directory, populates its immediate children,
and updates the JTree’s model. This ensures the tree reflects the user’s choice dynamically.

2. Optimization

Lazy Loading:
Implemented lazy loading using a TreeWillExpandListener. Directory nodes initially have a dummy child ("Loading...").

When expanded, the dummy child is removed, and the actual contents are loaded using populateChildren.
This reduces initial load time and memory usage, especially for large directories.

After updating a node’s children, reload(node) refreshes the tree display efficiently.

Efficient Data Handling:
Introduced a FileWrapper class that holds a File object but displays only the file name in the tree (via toString).

This preserves access to the full File object for operations like getting the absolute path or file size, avoiding
redundant path reconstruction.

Simplified Selection Logic:
The valueChanged method now directly retrieves the selected node’s FileWrapper, accessing the File object to display
detailed information (e.g., full path, size).

This eliminates the original code’s reliance on StringTokenizer and path string parsing, making it cleaner and more
reliable.

Error Handling:
Added basic checks in setNewRoot to ensure the selected root is a valid directory, showing an error dialog if not.

In populateChildren, listFiles() is checked for null to avoid exceptions on inaccessible directories.

3. Code Cleanliness
Modular Methods:
Extracted node creation (createNode) and child population (populateChildren) into separate methods for reusability and
readability.

Consistent Naming:
Used meaningful variable names (e.g., scrollPane instead of sp, label instead of l) to enhance maintainability.

Lambda Usage:
Employed a lambda expression for the ActionListener to keep the code concise.

Benefits
Dynamic: Users can now explore any directory on their system, not just a hardcoded path.
Optimized: Lazy loading ensures the application remains responsive with large file structures, and direct File object
access improves efficiency.
User-Friendly: Displays file names in the tree while providing detailed info (path, size) in the label.
