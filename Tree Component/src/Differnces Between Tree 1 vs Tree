Differences Between the Two Codes Layout and Component Positioning:

Code 1st: Tree1\SwingTree.java

Code 2nd: Tree\SwingTree.java

First Code:
The scroll pane containing the tree is added to the NORTH region of the frame using BorderLayout.
The label is added to the SOUTH region.

Second Code:
The scroll pane is added to the CENTER region.
The label is still added to the SOUTH region.

Impact:
In the first code, the tree appears at the top of the frame,
while in the second code it occupies the main center area, which might allow more space for displaying the tree.


Tree Node Construction (Building the Directory Structure):

First Code:
When iterating over the files in the directory, if an entry is a directory, it creates a temporary node
using the directory name.
Then, for each file inside that directory, it creates a node using the child file’s name (y.getName()) and adds
it to the temporary node.

Second Code:
The outer loop is similar, but inside the inner loop (while processing the contents of a directory),
it mistakenly adds a node using the parent directory’s name (x.getName()) instead of the child file’s name.

Impact:
The first code correctly displays the subfiles/subdirectories for each directory.

The second code will add multiple nodes with the same name (the parent directory name) instead of showing the
actual names of its children, which appears to be a bug.


Tree Selection Handling:

First Code:
In the valueChanged method, it obtains the full path as a string, tokenizes it using a StringTokenizer
(with delimiters "," and "]"), and then uses only the last token to update the label.
This tends to display just the most specific node (e.g., the selected file or folder name).

Second Code:
It directly calls e.getPath().toString() and sets that string to the label.
This will display the complete path from the root node to the selected node.


Impact:
The first code gives a simplified output (likely just the final selected item).

The second code shows the full hierarchical path.

Window Title and Class Naming:

First Code:
Does not explicitly set a title via a call to super(...) in the constructor.

Second Code:
Uses super("Tree Demo") to set the window title.

Impact:
The second code provides a window title for better context.


Logic of the Codes:

Both codes are designed to create a simple Swing application that: Builds a Tree View from a Directory.

They begin by creating a root node for a directory.

They list all the files and subdirectories in that directory.

For each file:
If it is a directory, they create a node representing the directory.

They then iterate over its children (the files within that directory) and add each one as a child node to the
directory node.

If the file is not a directory, it is added directly as a child of the root node.

This results in a tree structure (using DefaultMutableTreeNode) that mirrors the file system hierarchy
starting at the given path.


Displays the Tree in a GUI:

A JTree is created using the constructed node structure.

The tree is then placed inside a JScrollPane so that if the tree is large, scroll bars allow navigation.

The scroll pane is added to the frame, with its placement (NORTH vs. CENTER) affecting its size and position.


Handles Tree Selections:
Both classes implement the TreeSelectionListener interface.

When the user selects a node in the tree, the valueChanged method is called.

In the first code, the selected path is tokenized, and only the last token is shown in a label.

In the second code, the entire tree path is converted to a string and displayed in the label.

This provides immediate feedback on which node is selected.

Basic Frame Setup:

A JFrame is used as the main window.

The frame is set to a specific size (400x400) and made visible.

The default close operation is set to exit the application when the window is closed.

Summary:
The primary differences lie in how the tree nodes are built
(correctly handling subfiles vs. mistakenly reusing parent names),
how the tree selection is processed (tokenizing to extract the last element vs. showing the full path),
and the layout used to position components within the frame.

Both codes aim to create a GUI that displays a file directory as a tree and updates a label based on the
user's selection.

The logic involves file system traversal, constructing a Swing JTree, and handling user interactions via a listener.
