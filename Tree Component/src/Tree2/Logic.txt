These are import statements to bring in necessary classes from Java libraries:

javax.swing.*: Provides GUI components like JFrame, JTree, JLabel, etc.
javax.swing.event.*: Includes event-handling classes, such as TreeSelectionListener.
javax.swing.tree.*: Provides tree-specific classes like DefaultMutableTreeNode.
java.awt.*: Includes layout managers like BorderLayout.
java.io.*: Provides file handling classes like File.
java.util.StringTokenizer: A utility class to split strings into tokens.


Implements TreeSelectionListener to handle events when a tree node is selected.


    JTree tree;
    JLabel label;
Declares two instance variables:
tree: A JTree object to display the file system hierarchy.
label: A JLabel to show details of the selected file or directory.

Constructor
    MyFrame() {
        super("File Tree Demo");

Constructor for MyFrame.
Calls the superclass (JFrame) constructor with the title "File Tree Demo" for the window.
        String rootPath = "C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing";
        DefaultMutableTreeNode root = new DefaultMutableTreeNode(rootPath);
        File rootFile = new File(rootPath);

rootPath: Specifies the root directory to explore (e.g., "C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing").
root: Creates a DefaultMutableTreeNode (a node in the tree) with the root path as its data.
rootFile: Creates a File object representing the root directory.

        if (rootFile.exists() && rootFile.isDirectory()) {
            for (File file : rootFile.listFiles()) {

Checks if rootFile exists and is a directory.
Loops through all files and subdirectories in rootFile using listFiles() (returns an array of File objects).
                if (file.isDirectory()) {
                    DefaultMutableTreeNode dirNode = new DefaultMutableTreeNode(file.getName());

If the current file is a directory:
Creates a new DefaultMutableTreeNode called dirNode with the directory's name (e.g., "folder1").
                    for (File subfile : file.listFiles()) {
                        dirNode.add(new DefaultMutableTreeNode(subfile.getName()));
                    }
                    root.add(dirNode);

Loops through all files/subdirectories in the current directory.
Adds each file/subdirectory as a child node to dirNode using its name.
Adds dirNode (the directory node) as a child of the root node.

                } else {
                    root.add(new DefaultMutableTreeNode(file.getName()));
                }

If the current file is not a directory (i.e., it’s a file):
Adds it directly as a child node to root with its name (e.g., "file.txt").
        }

Closes the if block that checks if the root directory exists.
        tree = new JTree(root);
        tree.addTreeSelectionListener(this);
        JScrollPane sp = new JScrollPane(tree);

Creates a JTree object with root as the top node, representing the file hierarchy.
Adds this (the MyFrame instance) as a TreeSelectionListener to handle node selection events.
Wraps the tree in a JScrollPane for scrollability if the tree is too large.

        label = new JLabel("No file selected");

Initializes the label with default text "No file selected".
        setLayout(new BorderLayout());
        add(sp, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        add(label, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

Sets the layout of the JFrame to BorderLayout.
Adds the JScrollPane (containing the tree) to the center of the frame.
Adds the label to the bottom (south) of the frame.

TreeSelectionListener Implementation:
    @Override
    public void valueChanged(TreeSelectionEvent e) {
Implements the valueChanged method from TreeSelectionListener.

This method is triggered whenever a user selects a node in the tree.
        TreePath tp = e.getPath();

Gets the TreePath of the selected node (a path from the root to the selected node).

        StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(tp.toString(), "[,]");
        StringBuilder fullPath = new StringBuilder();

tp.toString() returns the path as a string like "[C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing, folder1, file.txt]".
StringTokenizer splits this string into tokens using "[" and "," as delimiters.
fullPath: A StringBuilder to reconstruct the full file path.

        while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
            String token = tokenizer.nextToken().trim();
            if (!token.isEmpty()) {

Loops through each token (e.g., "C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing", "folder1", "file.txt").
Trims whitespace from each token and checks if it’s not empty.

                if (fullPath.length() == 0) {
                    fullPath.append(token);
                } else {
                    fullPath.append(File.separator).append(token);
                }

If fullPath is empty (first token):
Appends the token directly (e.g., "C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing").

Otherwise:
Appends the platform-specific file separator (e.g., "" on Windows) followed by the token.
            }
        }

Closes the token-processing loop. At this point, fullPath contains the complete path
(e.g., "C:\Users\somes\Downloads\Java-Swing\folder1\file.txt").
        File selectedFile = new File(fullPath.toString());
        String details;

Creates a File object from the reconstructed path.
Declares a details string to store information about the selected file.
        if (selectedFile.exists()) {
            if (selectedFile.isDirectory()) {
                details = "Directory: " + selectedFile.getAbsolutePath();
            } else {
                details = "File: " + selectedFile.getAbsolutePath() +
                        " | Size: " + selectedFile.length() + " bytes";
            }
        } else {
            details = "Path does not exist: " + fullPath.toString();
        }

If the file/directory exists:
If it’s a directory: Sets details to show it’s a directory with its absolute path.
If it’s a file: Sets details to show it’s a file, its absolute path, and size in bytes.
If it doesn’t exist:
Sets details to indicate the path is invalid.

        label.setText(details);

Updates the label text with the details string.
Main Method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
The main method is the entry point of the program.

SwingUtilities.invokeLater ensures the GUI is created on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), which is a Swing best practice.
            MyFrame f = new MyFrame();
            f.setSize(500, 500);
            f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
            f.setVisible(true);
        });
    }

Creates a MyFrame instance.
Sets the window size to 500x500 pixels.
Configures the frame to exit the application when closed.
Makes the frame visible.

What Does This Code Do?
This program creates a Swing-based GUI application that:
Displays a tree structure of files and directories starting from a specified root path ("C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing").
Shows directories as expandable nodes with their contents as children.
Displays files as leaf nodes.
