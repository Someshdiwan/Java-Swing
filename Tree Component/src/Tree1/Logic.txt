This code creates a GUI application that displays a file system hierarchy in a tree structure and updates a
label based on user selection.

javax.swing.*: Imports Swing GUI components (e.g., JFrame, JTree, JLabel).
javax.swing.event.*: Imports event-handling classes (e.g., TreeSelectionListener for tree selection events).
java.awt.*: Imports AWT classes (e.g., BorderLayout for layout management).
javax.swing.tree.*: Imports tree-specific classes (e.g., DefaultMutableTreeNode for tree nodes).
java.io.*: Imports file-handling classes (e.g., File for file system operations).
java.util.StringTokenizer: Imports a utility class to split strings into tokens based on delimiters.


Implements TreeSelectionListener, meaning this class will handle events triggered when a user selects a node in the tree.

    JTree t;
    JLabel l;

Logic and Purpose: Declares two instance variables:

t: A JTree object that will display the file system hierarchy as a tree structure.
l: A JLabel object that will display the name of the selected file or directory (or a default message).

Constructor:

    MyFrame() {
Logic and Purpose: This is the constructor for the MyFrame class, responsible for setting up the GUI components and logic

DefaultMutableTreeNode drive = new DefaultMutableTreeNode("C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing");
Logic and Purpose:
Creates a DefaultMutableTreeNode object named drive, which serves as the root node of the tree.

The string "C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing" is the label for this node, representing the starting directory path.

File f1 = new File("C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing");
Logic and Purpose:
Creates a File object f1 that points to the directory "C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing".

This object will be used to access the actual files and subdirectories in the file system.

for (File x : f1.listFiles()) {

Logic and Purpose:
f1.listFiles() returns an array of File objects representing all files and subdirectories in the specified directory.

This for loop iterates over each File object (x) in that array.
            if (x.isDirectory()) {
                DefaultMutableTreeNode temp = new DefaultMutableTreeNode(x.getName());

Logic and Purpose:
x.isDirectory() checks if x is a directory.

If true, creates a new DefaultMutableTreeNode called temp with the directory’s name (e.g., "folder1"),
retrieved using x.getName().

                for (File y : x.listFiles())
                    temp.add(new DefaultMutableTreeNode(y.getName()));
                drive.add(temp);

Logic and Purpose:
x.listFiles() gets all files and subdirectories within the directory x.
The inner for loop iterates over each File object (y) in x.
For each y, a new DefaultMutableTreeNode is created with y.getName() (e.g., "file.txt") and
added as a child to temp using temp.add().
After populating temp with its children, temp (the directory node) is added as a child to the drive node using drive.add().

            } else
                drive.add(new DefaultMutableTreeNode(x.getName()));

Logic and Purpose:
If x.isDirectory() is false (i.e., x is a file), a new DefaultMutableTreeNode is created with the file’s name
(e.g., "file.txt").
This node is added directly to the drive node as a child, since files don’t have sub-nodes.
        }

Logic and Purpose: Closes the outer for loop that processes all files and directories in f1.
        t = new JTree(drive);
        JScrollPane jp = new JScrollPane(t);

Logic and Purpose:
t = new JTree(drive) creates a JTree object with drive as its root node, building the visual tree structure.
JScrollPane jp = new JScrollPane(t) wraps the JTree in a scroll pane, allowing scrolling if the tree exceeds
the visible area.
        l = new JLabel("No Files Selected");

Logic and Purpose:
Initializes the JLabel object l with the default text "No Files Selected", shown before any node is selected.
        t.addTreeSelectionListener(this);

Logic and Purpose:
Registers this (the MyFrame instance) as a TreeSelectionListener for the JTree object t.

This means the valueChanged method (defined later) will be called when a tree node is selected.
        add(jp, BorderLayout.NORTH);
        add(l, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

Logic and Purpose:
add(jp, BorderLayout.NORTH) adds the JScrollPane (containing the tree) to the northern (top) region of the
JFrame using BorderLayout.

add(l, BorderLayout.SOUTH) adds the JLabel to the southern (bottom) region of the JFrame.
TreeSelectionListener Implementation
    @Override
    public void valueChanged(TreeSelectionEvent e) {

Logic and Purpose:
This method is required by the TreeSelectionListener interface.

It’s triggered whenever a user selects a node in the JTree, passing a TreeSelectionEvent object (e) with
selection details.
        TreePath tp = e.getPath();

Logic and Purpose:
e.getPath() retrieves the TreePath of the selected node, which represents the full path from the
root to the selected node (e.g., [C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing, folder1, file.txt]).

        StringTokenizer sz = new StringTokenizer(tp.toString(), ",]");

Logic and Purpose:
tp.toString() converts the TreePath to a string, like "[C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing, folder1, file.txt]".

StringTokenizer splits this string into tokens using , and ] as delimiters
(e.g., tokens: "[C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing", " folder1", " file.txt").

        String str = "";
        while (sz.hasMoreTokens())
            str = sz.nextToken();

Logic and Purpose:
Initializes an empty string str.
Loops through all tokens from StringTokenizer.
Each iteration overwrites str with the next token, so str ends up with the last token (e.g., " file.txt"),
which is the selected node’s name.
        l.setText(str);

Logic and Purpose:
Updates the JLabel text to display str (e.g., " file.txt"), showing the name of the selected file or directory.

Main Class and Method
java
public class SwingTree {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Logic and Purpose:
Defines the main class SwingTree, which contains the program’s entry point.
main is the starting method executed when the program runs.

        MyFrame f = new MyFrame();
        f.setSize(400, 400);
        f.setVisible(true);
        f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    }
}

Logic and Purpose:
MyFrame f = new MyFrame() creates an instance of MyFrame, triggering its constructor to set up the GUI.
f.setSize(400, 400) sets the window size to 400x400 pixels.
f.setVisible(true) makes the window visible on the screen.
f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE) ensures the application exits when the window is closed.

Overall Functionality:

This code creates a Swing-based GUI application that:
Displays a tree structure of files and directories starting from "C://Users//somes//Downloads//Java-Swing".
Represents directories as expandable nodes with their contents (files and subdirectories) as children.
Represents files as leaf nodes (non-expandable).
Updates a label at the bottom with the name of the selected file or directory when a user clicks a node in the tree.
Each line contributes to building this file explorer-like interface, leveraging Swing components, file system operations,
and event handling to provide an interactive experience.
