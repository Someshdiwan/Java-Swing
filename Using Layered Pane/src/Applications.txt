Layered panes are used to manage components that overlap and need controlled stacking in a user interface.

In practical applications, you might use a layered pane when:

Creating Multi-Window Interfaces:
In applications that simulate a desktop environment (like an MDI – Multiple Document Interface), you can have multiple
internal frames or panels that overlap, similar to windows on your computer.

Implementing Drag-and-Drop:
When you need to allow users to drag elements around a container, a layered pane makes it easy to control which
element appears on top as they are moved.

Building Custom Visual Effects:
Applications like graphic editors, games, or mapping tools often require elements (such as tool palettes,
pop-up notifications, or overlays) that need to appear over other components.

Dynamic Content Display:
You might display temporary information or interactive elements (like tooltips, floating menus, or status indicators)
that should appear above the main content without disturbing the overall layout.

The aim of using a layered pane is to give you fine control over the "z-order" of components—the order in which they
are painted on the screen—so that you can dynamically change which elements are visible, provide interactive experiences,
or create more engaging interfaces.
